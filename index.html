    1.  For our nav we want to make use of the patterns that are known across the web, most users immediately associate a unrealted line of words at the top of the screen is probably the navigation. Among other things I fixed a problem with the nav where it would collapse underneath the  logo and thus the pattern of navs being on top of the screen was broken as it was now on line number 2. To fix this I made sure the nav didn't break and collapse underneath the Nav, in CSS I gave the nav less word-spacing, this lesser amount of word-spacing gave the nav room, it gave the nav room enough to stay on the top line of the page, and also have the nav maintain enough distance from the logo so that their differences is made clear, the nav is not a description of the logo, as one could believe from the previous close text hierarchy that aros between the logo and the collapsed nav, now they are both separated and clearly signal different things, one being the logo, a word larger than the others alone at the top of the screen, with more asthethic details than necessary for something purely functional and the nav with a font without serifs, a modern wide stance font with a clear readable modern look.  A sans serif font is usually easier to read on screen because they have simpler design than serif fonts, I wanted to avoid a neo-grotesque sans serifs like Helvetica, for the nav of a science museum their functionality is all that matters, something I found to blend well with the brand of a science museum, science seeks to find the facts and make no mistakes about them, as a basic font clings to the excact form of a letter and gives us the information we need with the uttermost readability, since there is no extra stylistic elements to riddle with the reader. 


2- I changed some of the functionality of the page, now the button now the button indicates physicality  which shows the user they can interact, I use shadows that fall of to the side, an asymmetry that indicated it is not an extension of the button shape, rather something organic that has come in from the side, a random extra shape caused by light from the side. This indicates the button is  clickable, using a JavaScript onclick function(). We want the user to easily understand, all levels of technicality are welcome, after all the science museum seeks to teach the broad public about science, the fundament of human civilisation, and in the high arts also lays a
humble nature that knows the value of all humans. so we seek to add the obvious affordances and also the pattern affordances, so we also add the physical affordance. In addition to text/language, on the button it ays
View More, and the text hierarchy of that button. With on hover we further prove the interactivity of the button by having the button change as soon as the action device (the pointer) travels across the button. We change and also remove different classes from the non-hover button, this is an effective way to take use of all that we have. 
We call this a hidden affordance, when the button changes on hover state, the user experiences it only when  in hover state, all of it a variety of thingss to help make the science museum available to all types of people, we want to share information in the most transparent and welcoming way possible, technology is a medium of exchange, it must avoid becoming a hindrance as the digital world is so important.  Since the science museum is a broad offer to the public it's layout and functionality must convey this message, so we use all affordances we can in addition to language and patterns, this gives use a very clear, well communicated message across our layout.

3. I changed the positioning of the headline to improve the text hierarchy. 
  It is important the the title element of the page, in this case represented through our H1, I wanted to move it closer to the content it is describing so there is no doubt of the connection between it and the other content it represents. We need structure because users looking at a page scan it quickly to find reelvant content, therefore the excact placement of headlines is really important. 

we mark up such instances

    2. Changed the font of the nav to  better fit the image  of the museum page, also ,we avoid using such a common font that ic can be viewed as the content not loading properly. I wanted to improved the nav so the user can experience the most efficient way of navigating possible. Interaction Design is known for discussing doors that are built for aesthetics rather than practicality, we therefore wanted to choose a font for our vital nav functionality. We choose a font without serifs and went with practicality. We wanted the font to be as common and basic that anybody would recognise the letters immediately. The interaction between a human and a product is usually one of many and people are not to be expected to have to decipher vastly different aesthetic each time, especially for something as important to the wide public as a science museum. Spreading knowledge about our worlds technology is a public duty. An interaction designed must take into account the three following areas: buisness goals: an interaction designed must understand what the buisness is trying to achieve with its website or app and how the marketing team is looking to achieve those goals. We know that we want the page to give the user a good experience and to make people buy tickets to our museum. The user is on the page to get information about the museum and learn what they can do.  It is important to put the user first. We've chosen to use the colours and fonts we have because of the minimal, modern look that prefers functionality over aesthetics and the powerful, energetic colours that can best represent important technology that represents important powers in our world. A dense, rich colour that shows richness. The colour purple has a variety of effects on the mind and body, including uplifting spirits and calming the mind and nerves, we combine this with a more red tone to get a more fierce energy that combines with high velocity technology. To give the impression of excitement that comes with important technology.

1. We used rem because that way the font doesn't rely on it's parent element, we can decide more independently, gives us more choice for our font

utilised id to overwrite a class and it's default css styling, so in certain cases, isolated on the page that was given the additional id styling, the class now appears different on that page only, in certain cases, only the parts using that class with id. So in this way I can keep all the styling from that class and also cherry pick a certain div that receives some styling on top of that without disturbing the other classes as they are without id. Id overwrites the class and is very useful for optimal customization of the page to fit certain types of brands. When you want all to be streamlined a certain way, it is important to have full control of the styling in all scenarios, so I use styling  to give it that coherent design with slight anomalies. A way to be very precise with your coding, to use classes and then instead of creating new classes just add an id and be specific and neat with your code. Less code is the best option given the same functionality. It's important to know the difference between em and rem units. I wanted to take control over the relativeness of some of the fonts, as they we're scaling in the wrong way, so I used rem units for the blogPost class. We know that both remem and em are scalable. Both rem and em are scalable , they are considered relative units of size. I wanted to use rem rather than em because rem doesn't rely on the parent element of the , while the rem unit is only relative to thhe root font size of the HTML document. We used rem so that it keeps away from growing into the wrong size base on the size of the parent element, we had a crash in font size. We wanted to remove the function that makes the font-size of this exact font dependent on the font-size of its parent. </p>
