    2. Changed the font of the nav to  better fit the image  of the museum page, also ,we avoid using such a common font that ic can be viewed as the content not loading properly. I wanted to improved the nav so the user can experience the most efficient way of navigating possible. Interaction Design is known for discussing doors that are built for aesthetics rather than practicality, we therefore wanted to choose a font for our vital nav functionality. We choose a font without serifs and went with practicality. We wanted the font to be as common and basic that anybody would recognise the letters immediately. The interaction between a human and a product is usually one of many and people are not to be expected to have to decipher vastly different aesthetic each time, especially for something as important to the wide public as a science museum. Spreading knowledge about our worlds technology is a public duty. An interaction designed must take into account the three following areas: buisness goals: an interaction designed must understand what the buisness is trying to achieve with its website or app and how the marketing team is looking to achieve those goals. We know that we want the page to give the user a good experience and to make people buy tickets to our museum. The user is on the page to get information about the museum and learn what they can do.  It is important to put the user first. We've chosen to use the colours and fonts we have because of the minimal, modern look that prefers functionality over aesthetics and the powerful, energetic colours that can best represent important technology that represents important powers in our world. A dense, rich colour that shows richness. The colour purple has a variety of effects on the mind and body, including uplifting spirits and calming the mind and nerves, we combine this with a more red tone to get a more fierce energy that combines with high velocity technology. To give the impression of excitement that comes with important technology.

1. We used rem because that way the font doesn't rely on it's parent element, we can decide more independently, gives us more choice for our font

utilised id to overwrite a class and it's default css styling, so in certain cases, isolated on the page that was given the additional id styling, the class now appears different on that page only, in certain cases, only the parts using that class with id. So in this way I can keep all the styling from that class and also cherry pick a certain div that receives some styling on top of that without disturbing the other classes as they are without id. Id overwrites the class and is very useful for optimal customization of the page to fit certain types of brands. When you want all to be streamlined a certain way, it is important to have full control of the styling in all scenarios, so I use styling  to give it that coherent design with slight anomalies. A way to be very precise with your coding, to use classes and then instead of creating new classes just add an id and be specific and neat with your code. Less code is the best option given the same functionality. It's important to know the difference between em and rem units. I wanted to take control over the relativeness of some of the fonts, as they we're scaling in the wrong way, so I used rem units for the blogPost class. We know that both remem and em are scalable. Both rem and em are scalable , they are considered relative units of size. I wanted to use rem rather than em because rem doesn't rely on the parent element of the , while the rem unit is only relative to thhe root font size of the HTML document. We used rem so that it keeps away from growing into the wrong size base on the size of the parent element, we had a crash in font size. We wanted to remove the function that makes the font-size of this exact font dependent on the font-size of its parent. </p>
